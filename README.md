# symfony-project
 
This project demonstrates a simple Symfony application that fetches users from a MySQL database. It uses Docker and Docker Compose to set up the environment with Apache and MySQL.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## What Was Done

- Developed a simple Symfony code to fetch users from MySQL.
- Built a Dockerfile for the Symfony app to install prerequisites.
- Created a Docker Compose setup with Symfony (served via Apache) and MySQL.
- A single `docker-compose up` command gets the app running alongside MySQL.
- You can test the app by accessing the route configured in the Symfony app (/users).
